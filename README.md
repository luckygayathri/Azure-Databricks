🔬 Project Overview

This an end-to-end data engineering project on the Azure cloud. Where I did data ingestion from a on-premise SQL Server to Azure Data Lake using Data Factory to transformation using Databricks and Spark, loading to Synapse, and reporting using PowerBI. Also, I used Azure Active Directory (AAD) and Azure Key Vault for the data monitoring and governance purpose.
